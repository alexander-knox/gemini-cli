# gemini-cli

Use Google's Gemini-Pro at the command line!

## Prerequisites

You can not use this script without a Google AI Studio API Key. You can get one [here](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey). The script is built to import this key from an environment variable named "KEY".

## Usage

This script was built on Ubuntu 22.04.3 using Python 3.10.12.

You can probably get this running on Ubuntu or another Linux distro, but I have no idea about Windows or MacOS, sorry.

To start the script, clone this repository and navigate to the directory which contains it, then run:

>python3 gemini.py

When you are done talking to Gemini-Pro and want to exit the script, you can type:

> exit

This will return you to the command line.
