# gemini-cli

Use Google's Gemini-Pro at the command line

This script has some dependencies, but I don't currently have all of them documented. Sorry.

To start the script, navigate to the directory which contains it and run:

>python3 ./gemini.py

When you are ready to exit the script and return to the command line, type:

> exit
